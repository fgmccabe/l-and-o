<p class="binderItem"><strong>Preface</strong><br/>Developing applications in a logic programming language is subject to the same issues as that face developers in other programming languages: programming is still a team sport; and safety is nearly always critical. L&O is a logic programming language that is oriented to development of complex applications that must be similarly safe and effective.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Software Engineering</strong><br/>Developing any kind of software is a complex task, made more difficult by the possibilities and risks offered by the Internet. Such complexity is not removed simply by adopting logic as the foundation of one’s languages. Integration, reliability, security, modularization, evolvability, versioning, safety are all qualities that are important for software systems that are independent of the underlying technology. For knowledge intensive applications the list continues – we also require flexibility...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Static Types</strong><br/>L&O is a strongly statically typed programming language. The purpose of using a static type system is to enhance programmers’ confidence in the correctness of the program – it cannot replace a formal proof of correctness.<br/>
<br/>
The type system of L&O is quite rich and expressive; this is intentional -- in order to reduce the _temptation_ to step outside the strict confines of type safety. Some of the features of L&O types include:<br/>
<br/>
 • Higher-order type terms that can denote function and other program...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Object Orientation</strong><br/>L&O’s object orderedness is fundamental to L&O’s approach to software engineering. To support the evolution of programs it is important to be able to modify a large program in a way that has manageable and predictable consequences. This is aided by having a clean separation between interfaces and implementations of components of the program. Being able to change the implementation of a component without changing all the references to the program is a basic benefit of object ordered programming.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Ontologies</strong><br/>Since L&O is a Logic Programming language, it makes sense to ask how suitable it is for developing Ontologies.<br/>
<br/>
## Meta-order and object-order<br/>
<br/>
Unlike **Prolog**, L&O does not permit data to be directly interpreted as code. The standard **Prolog** approach of using the same language for meta-level names of programs and programs themselves – which in turn allows program text to be manipulated like other data – has a number of technical problems; especially when considering distributed and secure ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The structure of this book </strong><br/>This book is intended to be read as an introduction to the language, to using it and to show how sophisticated programs can be built using its facilities. We assume some familiarity with programming, especially logic programming, although the pace is relatively gentle.<br/>
<br/>
Part I gets us started, with the style of L&O programs. Part II explores some programming examples and techniques. In Part III we look at the features of L&O in more detail. This book is not a reference manual for L&amp;O; howeve...</p>
